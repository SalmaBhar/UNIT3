# Diary App
## Criteria A: Planning
### Context of the problem
Many people like to keep diaries to document important events of their lives. However, paper diaries are old-school and take a lot of storage space [1].This project is a Diary App. It allows the user to keep a personal digital diary on their phone through an app. The user keeps their entries secure by creating an account and accessing their personal portal which allows them to enter and read diaries according to the date. <br>

### Justification of the solution
We will create an app program using Python as a programming language on the programming software PyCharm that is available by our school. We will be using the open source KivyMD in order to build our app interface and components. In fact, KivyMD is one of the most useful sources that makes app development on Python much easier and efficient [2]. We will also use SQL programming language to build 2 databases for the app: a database to store the user's account information and a database to store the journal entries of each user. The app will have 4 main screens: a registration screen, login screen, diary entries screen and a diary entries view screen. <br>

T.E.L.O.S. Study: <br>
T-Technical-Is the project technically possible? We dispose of a computer and PyCharm software for Python and KivyMD code. All technical necessities for this project are satisfied. <br>
E-Economic- Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit? This project is developed for free by UWC ISAK Japan students. Thanks to the funding provided to our school, we can afford all of the components necessary for the project. <br>
L-Legal- Is the project legal? The project is completely legal as the 1947 Japanese constitution does not criminalize small digital projects like ours. <br>
O-Operational- How will the current operations support the change? The project will operate on a computer and displayed on a phone. The process does not have any errors and is perfectly operational. <br>
S-Scheduling- Can the project be done in time? We are given 3 weeks to complete this project and the tasks have been regularly distributed to assure that it is completed by Thursday, April 1st, 2021. <br>

## Criteria C: Development
We ended up with the following Python code which will be run on PyCharm: <br>
```py
```
This is the code for our 2 databases:
```py
```
